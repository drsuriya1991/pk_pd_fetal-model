 Project Highlights: Decoding Fetal ExposureBridging the "Black Box" Gap: Traditional models often treat the fetal environment as an isolated entity; this framework provides a transparent, code-based window into the Maternal-Fetal-Amniotic loop.+1The Secretion Discovery: By introducing an active fetal renal secretion term ($CL_{sec,f}$), this model resolves the persistent under-prediction of Cefazolin in amniotic fluid, aligning \textit{in silico} results with real-world clinical data.+2Visualizing the "Amniotic Trap": Logarithmic concentration profiles reveal how drugs linger in the amniotic reservoir, demonstrating that fetal exposure persists long after maternal plasma has cleared the dose.+2Developmental Sensitivity: The scaffold explicitly models the maturation of fetal GFR and swallowing reflexes across gestational ages (25–40 weeks), identifying critical windows of exposure risk
